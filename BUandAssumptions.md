# Business Understanding & Basic Assumptions ..
## Financial
### Cash to Close
- $30,000 in starting personal capital
	- Remaining funds acquired through hard money / private investors
		- Too many regulations to buy through standard lenders
		- Hard money / private investors can close much quicker (Bridgewell Capital, n.d.)
			- Hitch is they only finance LLCs, not individuals
				- As an LLC we will be liable for Capital Gains and Self-Employment Taxes, as well as State Franchise & Excise taxes
					- Taxes will not be figured in this model, as it is an overall business expense
					- Therefore minimum prift will be considered pre-tax
		- 15% down payment required (purchase + rehab + closing costs) (Bridgewell Capital, n.d.)
		- 80% ARV max loan (Bridgewell Capital, n.d.)
	- 3 months tax escrow + 1 year home insurance required at closing
	- 6 months cash reserve of monthly payment
### General
- Monthly payment = Interest + Tax Escrow + Insurance Escrow
- Estimated yearly Insurance Premium for Vacant Dwelling = 0.5% of After Repair Value (ARV)
- According to Lyndi Nickerson, customary for seller to cover many closing costs in Clarksville market (L. Nickerson, personal communication, November, 2016)
- I have experience negotiating deals w/ Realtors to reduce commission if acting as buyer agent & selling agent.
	- I will therefore assume I will be able to negotiate a lower selling commission than customary 6%
- The market in and around Nashville is hot. Competition is fierce.
	- Would like min profit of 20%, but with competition this will likely be untennable
		- Intial target 12%
- Will focus on foreclosures at onset
	- Clarksville has an inordinate amount of foreclosures, due in large part to the high percentage of soldiers stationed at Fort Campbell
	- Do not have a marketing plan in place to be able to find under-the-radar properties
	- Do not have the available cash reserves to buy for cash at auction
## Scope
- Limit to houses built after 1979
	- Lead paint risk built <1978 (HUD, n.d.)
	- Asbestos risk built <1980 (EHS, 2016)
- Most rehab work to be completed by licensed contractors
- To ensure quality, we will likely keep our rehab somewhere between rehab & remodel, as well as standard and designer
	- As laid out in the rehab cost matrix by Villani and Davis (2007)
- Formula from Villani & Davis (2007) Estimated Project length = ($/SF rehab/10) * 2.5 months market/sell (Rounded up to whole month)

# Costs
## Buying Costs
- 3% of purchase price

## Selling Costs
- Commission - 5% of ARV
- Closing costs - 2% of ARV for seller costs, $3000 for buyer costs

## Holding Costs
- Insurance = 0.005*ARV*Project Time/12 months
- Lawn Maintenance - $150 per month * project time
- Taxes **Follow-up with Bryce / Erinne on Assessment process**
- Utilities $150 per month

## Money Costs
- 3.9% Upfront points for origination (Bridgewell Capital, n.d.)
- 12.95% simple annual interest (Bridgewell Capital, n.d.)

## Improvement Costs / Rehab Costs
- Villani and Davis (2007) have matrix, but for simplicity of model I will reduce to 1 number
	- Using our business scope find average in matrix for mid-range, Rehab/Remodel and Standard/Designer
	- Average is $22 per SF, which seems reasonable and in-line with our 1 previous flip
